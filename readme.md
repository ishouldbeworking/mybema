Mybema is an open source community platform. It allows users to participate in discussions and lets you create knowledgebase articles for your community.

Installation
============
You can install Mybema in one of two ways at the moment. We recommend using Ansible.

Using Ansible
-------------
The easy way to setup Mybema is to use the [mybema-config](http://www.github.com/pawel2105/mybema-config) repository. It uses [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) to provision a VPS on [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com).

The hard way
------------
If you don't want to use Ansible, you can run the following steps. First clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:pawel2105/mybema.git

Then install the dependencies:

    bundle install

Install Postgres if you haven't alrady

    brew install postgresql

Install Redis if you haven't alrady

    brew install redis

Install Elasticsearch if you haven't already

    brew install elasticsearch

Create a database configuration file:

    cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml

Create your database and run the migrations and the seeds:

    rake db:create db:migrate db:seed

Create a secrets configuration file:

    touch config/secrets.yml

Create a secret token using `rake secret` and add it into the file. You will also need to add your S3 credentials if you plan on using S3 for asset storage:

    development:
      secret_key_base: YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
      amazon_bucket: YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
      amazon_access_key_id: ACCESS_KEY_ID
      amazon_secret_access_key: ACCESS_KEY

    test:
      secret_key_base: YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN

    production:
      secret_key_base: YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN
      amazon_bucket: YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
      amazon_access_key_id: ACCESS_KEY_ID
      amazon_secret_access_key: ACCESS_KEY

From here you should be good to start up the server:

    bundle exec rails s

Running the tests
=================
You'll need to fire up elasticsearch as well as a redis server before running the test suite. Once they are up, simply run:

    rake test

Contributing
